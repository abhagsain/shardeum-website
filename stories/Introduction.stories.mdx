# Welcome to Shardeum Design System

Stitches

### DX

Intellisense is good. You write styles in a `css` prop.

```
<Box css={{borderRadius: '$2', width: '$24'}} />

```

IMO it pollutes the component. It's same as writing TailwindCSS but with component props.

### Responsiveness

Achievable. You can write media query inside the `css` prop like this.

```
<Box css={{ md: { backgroundColor: '$blue-500'}}}
```

### Theming

Easy to add

### Final Thoughts

I like it but I just don't like the css prop, basically you can put everything in that. px values etc. It's easier to move away from the Design System.
It's like in an inline style object the only different is you reference the values from the theme.

Don't want to write code like that :(
